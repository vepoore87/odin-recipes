        <img src="../images/recipes.png" alt="Recipe">

        <h1>Easy Roasted Broccoli</h1>

        <img src="../images/broccoli.jpg" alt="Broccoli">

        <p>Roasted broccoli is easy to make and so much more flavorsome than boiled. My favorite part is the roasted sliced stem pieces.

        </p>

        <h1>Ingredients</h1>

        <ul>
            <li>14 ounces broccoli</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Directions</h1>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Cut broccoli florets from the stalk. Peel the stalk and slice into 1/4-inch slices. Mix florets and stem pieces with olive oil in a bowl and transfer to a baking sheet; season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Roast in the preheated oven until broccoli is tender and lightly browned, about 18 to 20 minutes.    </li>
        </ol>

        <p>This recipe has a lot of sweetness and spice, so if you're looking for a classic homemade BBQ sauce that's easy to make, look no further. It is very popular with users of 'ceramic' type smokers and grills, (i.e. Primo, Kamado, Big Green Egg, etc.)
